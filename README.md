After taking a few Machine Learning courses, I decided to get hands on and create my own project using my knowledge from these courses and researching / learning myself. 
The goal is to use this repository to document my progress learning about regression / classification. 
Starting from the absolute basics, each commit will be an implementation of something I learnt from a course or researched myself.

I thought that this would be a fun idea to document my progress and see my progression (hopefully each commit actually improves the model)
